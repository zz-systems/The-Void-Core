### The Void Open source core

This is the repository for the open source core of "The Void" game available at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sphericalbrain.thevoid)
It includes: 
- Game logic made by myself
- Graphics made by myself
- Sounds made by myself

To get the project up and running, please refer to the required 3rd party components.
There may be some compilation errors due to data I want to make public and different data I want to keep private. Simply uncomment those parts. 

Please feel free to look and learn how (not) to make a game.
